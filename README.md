# aframe-registry

> Work in progress.

Curated collection of community A-Frame components.

Distributed as a JSON file for programmatic consumption.

## Guidelines

- Keep the components in alphabetical order.
- The `url` field should be a direct link to the hosted JS file.
- The JS file should automatically register the component with `AFRAME.registerComponent`.
